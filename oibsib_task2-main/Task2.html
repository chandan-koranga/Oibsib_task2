                    Kalpana Chawla was an Indian-American astronaut who became the first woman of Indian origin to go to space. 
                    She was born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, India, and died on February 1, 2003, in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
                    <br><br>
                    Chawla obtained her Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College in India in 1982. 
                    She then went on to obtain a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984 
                    and a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado in 1988.<br><br>
                    In 1994, Chawla was selected by NASA for its astronaut program, and in 1997, she flew her first mission as a mission specialist on the Space Shuttle Columbia. 
                    She became the first Indian woman to go to space. In 2003, Chawla was part of the crew on board the Space Shuttle Columbia when it disintegrated upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven crew members.<br><br>
                    Chawla received numerous awards and honors for her achievements, including the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the NASA Space Flight Medal, and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. 
                    She has also been posthumously honored by the Indian government, which renamed the satellite MetSat-1 to Kalpana-1 in her memory. Additionally, many schools, scholarships, 
                    and awards have been named after her to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.
